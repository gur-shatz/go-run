# execrun.yaml - file watcher configuration
# See: https://github.com/gur-shatz/go-run

# File patterns to watch (gitignore-style globs)
watch:
  - "**/*.go"
  - "go.mod"
  - "go.sum"

# Build commands — preparation steps that run to completion.
# If any step fails, the previous process keeps running.
build:
  - "go build -o ./bin/app ."

# Exec commands — the last command is the long-running managed process.
# If exec is empty, the target is build-only (no managed process).
exec:
  - "./bin/app"

# Examples:
#
# Build-only (no managed process):
#   build:
#     - "npm run build"
#     - "echo done"
#
# Run-only (no build steps):
#   exec:
#     - "python app.py"
#
# Go with code generation:
#   build:
#     - "go generate ./..."
#     - "go build -o ./bin/app ."
#   exec:
#     - "./bin/app"
#
# Node.js with TypeScript:
#   build:
#     - "npm run build"
#   exec:
#     - "node dist/index.js"
